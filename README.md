To accomplish McCabeâ€“Thiele method for the fucking chemical engineering experiment  
  
This is based on the EtOH/H2O system, but one can change it to any binary system by 
changing the data of equilibrium line(the x-y graph) in /data//*.csv or change the 
eq_line function in the script if you get an ideal binary system(where the equilibrium 
line can be formulated by y = ax/(1 + (a - 1)x)).
