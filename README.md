To accomplish McCabeâ€“Thiele method for the fucking chemical engineering experiment  
  
This is based on the EtOH/H2O system, but one can change it to any binary system by 
changing the data of equilibrium line in /data/\*.csv or change the eq_line function 
in the script if you get an ideal binary system(where the equilibrium line can be 
formulated by y = \alpha\*x/(1 + (\alpha - 1)x))
